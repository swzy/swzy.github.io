I'm back from taking a long hiatus. I wish I could say I was solving some amazingly interesting problems in the world in lieu of my work but alot of the lessons I have been learning were mostly about me.

I want to blog more regularly so that my feelings don't get so jumbled so this is my attempt at doing so. I am also restarting TheOdinProject to potentially get out of the data space at work into more active development and coding.

Let's see how it goes.
