I'm back from taking a long hiatus. I wish I could say I was solving some amazingly interesting problems in the world in lieu of my work but alot of the lessons I have been learning were mostly about me.

I want to blog more regularly so that my feelings don't get so jumbled so this is my attempt at doing so. I am also restarting TheOdinProject to potentially get out of the data space at work into more active development and coding.

Let's see how it goes.

Started from TOP WebDev101. Getting CSS is so tedious but for some reason I am stuck on trying to get it just right. Trying to replicate Google's home page and will have to spend more time tomorrow.
