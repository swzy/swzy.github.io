It's been extremely difficult, but I'm starting to get past the point where I'm reducing my problems to "laziness" and trying to take a more nuanced perspective and understanding of myself. As an example, I've struggled my entire life with totally trashing my self-esteem and confidence from my failures, real or perceived. It's a tactic that has worked for me in the past but, these days, I find that I shut down far more than I used to.

But like I said, I'm slowly getting better. And even though I have a private blog where this type of self-reflection may be more appropriate, I want to use this outlet to help keep myself accountable, both from a productivity standpoint but also just being better to myself.

# August 2020 Summation
* Covered JavaScript basics and restarted TheOdinProject
* Started using VueJS and Vuetify to overengineer a Rock-Paper-Scissors game
* Blogged days: 6 out of 31
* Coding days: 10 out of 31 (approximate)
* I'm a little disappointed in my progress this month as I fell into some of the traps I've historically gone through when trying to learn and fit something new into my life. But, I am hopeful as it is still as good a (re)start as any.

## Goals for Next Month
* Continue getting comfortable with JavaScript callbacks, promises, fetch API, and general syntax
* Start Leetcoding with JavaScript
* Make at least a few posts in TheOdinProject discord or other programming communities
