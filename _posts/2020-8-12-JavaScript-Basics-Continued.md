Organically got myself into starting another project last night. After discussing some of the processes my friend has created for a side income business, I realized that some of the business requirements were well known enough to have a clear vision of what a software solution could tangibly provide in the short term!

Though it was literally discussed a little more than 12 hours ago I think the project is a great way to begin building out something larger by starting with something small and crucial. The first system to build out will be a price aggregator using vendor APIs as well as the JavaScript fetch API. Was able to mock up something in an hour or two last night as well!

Today I will continue TheOdinProject and work on reading and chewing on the material slowly. ;)
