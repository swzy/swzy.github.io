![The Odin Project](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn-images-1.medium.com%2Fmax%2F1200%2F1*60u1QENWMOJXaLQ1xzn0TQ.png&f=1&nofb=1)

Over my time digging for learning resources I kept hearing about The Odin Project as a great resource for helping newly-minted coders and self-starters to learn web development. And I'm pleased to say they were right! I will be using The Odin Project to solidify my gooey skills into something respectable and effective!

Very excited!! :D
