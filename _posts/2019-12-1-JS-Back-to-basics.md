![ES6 JS](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffrontendmasters.com%2Fassets%2Fes6-logo-300x300.png&f=1&nofb=1)

After about a year of working on a research team involved in data analytics, I now plan on relearning and reinforcing my knowledge of ES6 JavaScript as well as a modern web framework to learn and create something that is interesting to me (on my own time of course).

My primary intention of learning the basics of JavaScript and front-end web programming is to have a creative outlet that can support and improve my overall technological skill and keep my 'development brain' thriving. Whether I explicitly acknowledge it or not, I've always had an interest in UI/UX and the aesthetics that go into creating a pleasurable experience. I appreciate the minimalist looks that many websites and applications have adopted and I want to organically learn how to create that design and the transitions/animations that comprise the overall look-feel of that aesthetic - even if I don't use that knowledge in my everyday work.

I plan to learn the basics so that I can effectively employ a modern front-end web framework such as VueJS or ReactJS. This is a way to keep the hobby relevant and potentially integral in supporting my livelihood or supplementary income. I have interests in learning the back-end routing and configuration that may go into supporting a web application as well, but, from a dozen or so hours of preliminary forays into back-end frameworks, the learning curve of the 'basics' seems so far and away from the realities of supporting a real app in production that I don't think it is an efficient use of time to learn all that 'theory' when it really isn't that satisfying to learn how to serve and route some random 'Hello World' type pages to no one but myself.

Who knows, maybe I'll be able to integrate this knowledge with my current growing skillset in the Data/ETL/DevOps space one day into a role I'm not even currently anticipating!
