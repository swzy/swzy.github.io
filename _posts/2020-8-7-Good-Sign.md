Two days in a row. Not a trend yet but it's a good sign. Will get back to that CSS problem.. A bit worried that it is taking too much time but moving the styles around little by little is therapeutic in a twisted kind of way.

Almost there. It's been interesting avoiding the ``` { display: block; display: inline-block; } ``` CSS declarations and sticking to Flexbox. I think this will serve me better in learning to organize web page layouts in the long run but I'm sure that making finicky, fine-grained margin/padding adjustments to compensate for not knowing how to use the other display properties is not best practice.

Finished! Not too shabby if I say so myself. Probably took way too long though.
